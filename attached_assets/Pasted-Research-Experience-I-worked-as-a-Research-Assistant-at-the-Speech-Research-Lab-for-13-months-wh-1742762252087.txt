Research Experience:
 I worked as a Research Assistant at the Speech Research Lab for 13 months, where I was actively
 involved in cutting-edge research in speech processing. My work primarily focused on analyzing various
 feature sets such as MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), LFCC (Linear-Frequency Cepstral
 Coefficients), and LFRCC (Linear-Frequency Residual Cepstral Coefficients).
 In addition to feature extraction, I gained extensive experience working with Machine Learning and
 Deep Learning models applied to speech-related tasks. I specifically worked on advanced speech
 technologies like Whisper, wav2vec 2.0, and AASIST, enhancing my understanding of state-of-the-art
 speech recognition and speaker verification systems.
 I was also part of the data collection team creating the world’s first dysarthric speech dataset in
 Indian languages. As part of this initiative, I conducted fieldwork, including data collection at
 Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, ensuring high-quality and diverse data acquisition.
 Additionally, I contributed to a government-sponsored project funded by the Ministry of Electronics
 and Information Technology (MeitY) for 3 months. This opportunity allowed me to collaborate on
 impactful projects addressing real-world challenges in speech and audio processing.
 During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to mentor three students from KL University
 Hyderabad, guiding them in their research projects:
 ● TeagerEnergy Cepstral Coefficients for Audio Deepfake Detection: This work was accepted
 at APSIPA ASC 2024, showcasing its relevance and impact. Link
 ● Singfake Detection
 ● LFRCCforAudioDeepfake Detection
 This mentorship experience enabled me to develop leadership and mentoring skills, while also
 contributing to innovative research in the rapidly evolving area of deepfake detection.
 Mystrong command of Python and its associated libraries has been integral to implementing and
 optimizing speech and audio models effectively.
 I have also contributed to international research dissemination with submissions to prestigious
 conferences, including:
 ● Odyssey: The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop
 ● Interspeech: The Conference of the International Speech Communication Association
 ● APSIPA:Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Conference
 Notably, my paper submitted to APSIPA was accepted, reflecting the quality and significance of my
 research contributions.
Through this journey, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in speech research, data collection,
 mentorship, and collaborative project execution, strengthening my commitment to advancing the field of
 speech and audio technology.
 Internship Experience: (6 weeks)
 I interned as a Solutions Software Engineer Intern at OpsHub Inc. from May 2023 to July 2023 in
 Ahmedabad, Gujarat. During this industrial experience:
 ● Ideveloped a Java-based Reset Password Utility for OpsHub’s OIM product, streamlining
 password reset processes and significantly enhancing system security.
 ● Icontributed to migration projects, facilitating seamless transitions for clients to OpsHub’s
 solutions or other target platforms.
 ● Igained hands-on experience with Spring and Spring Boot frameworks, which provided me with
 practical insights into their versatile applications and importance in modern software
 development.
 This internship strengthened my software development skills, particularly in Java and related frameworks,
 and equipped me with practical knowledge of solving real-world software engineering challenges.
 Rural Internship Experience:
 I completed a 21-day mandatory internship with Elixir Foundation, where we worked in rural areas of
 Ahmedabad to bridge the gap between government initiatives and the local communities. During this
 internship, our primary role was to educate rural residents about various government schemes and the
 benefits they could avail to improve their quality of life.
 Our team conducted on-ground awareness sessions to explain how these schemes could address critical
 issues such as healthcare, education, financial support, and agricultural aid. To ensure accessibility and
 practical solutions, we also provided technology-based interventions that simplified processes like
 scheme enrollment and accessing digital resources.
 This experience allowed me to:
 ● Developeffective communication skills to convey complex information to diverse audiences.
 ● Understand the challenges faced by rural communities and propose practical solutions tailored
 to their needs.
 ● Collaborate with a team to solve real-world problems, ensuring impactful outreach.
 Through this internship, I not only contributed to empowering rural communities but also gained valuable
 insights into grassroots development and the role of technology in driving social progress.
Co-Curricular Activities:
 ● AcademicAchievements:
 ○ Secured 2nd position in the International Mathematics Olympiad at the school level
 during my 11th standard, showcasing strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
 ○ Represented Gujarat State at the National Level UCMAS Competition, a prestigious
 mental arithmetic contest. At the district level, I won the Silver Medal for exceptional
 performance.
 ● SportsParticipation:
 ○ Actively participated in sports and was a part of both my school and college basketball
 teams, which helped me build teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills.
 ● Leadership Role:
